## Yufan & Junkai

The big picture introduction of the GFW and the state-of-the-art bypassing
solutions is fascinating.
The especially interesting part is how the GFW detects suspicious websites
that actually host Trojan hosts.

It would be nice to have a concrete example of a certain payload being encrypted
by Trojan so it feels less abstract.

## Beilong

It is nice to see the history of MQTT as a protocol to unify oil pipeline
monitoring.

The claim that MQTT does not require encoding but HTTP does, though,
is suspicious to me.
MQTT has a header encoding, but the encoding of the body is unspecified.

## Max

The broad range of aspects of Bluetooth you covered is very informative.
The talk is clear and easy to understand.

However, it would be nicer to summarize the main takeaways from this technology
so views can have something left in their mind after they finish watching.
